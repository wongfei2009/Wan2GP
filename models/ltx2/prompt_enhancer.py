# LTX2 Prompt Guidelines

## Standard Prompts

- Describe the subject, setting, action, camera, lighting, mood, and visual style in concrete cinematic language.
- Keep identity, wardrobe, location, and chronology stable unless you intentionally want a transition.
- Write the visible action in temporal order. LTX2 usually behaves better when it can follow a clear sequence instead of a pile of disconnected tags.
- Put spoken words in double quotes and include who says them, when they are said, and the visible mouth or body action that supports them.
- For better clarity, use multiline prompts (each paragraph separated by an empty line should correspond to a sliding window prompt) in **How to Process each Line of the Text Prompt**. Use one line per shot, beat, character action, or generated item depending on the selected line-processing mode.

## Relayed Prompts

Prompt Relay lets you keep one global prompt for the whole clip and then apply timed subprompts to specific parts of the video. The first text before any valid `[]` range is the global prompt.

Accepted range syntax:

- `[0%:25%]` percentage of the full clip.
- `[25%:]` percentage start, open end, meaning the rest of the clip.
- `[1:5]` 1-based frame numbers, from frame 1 through frame 5.
- `[0s:4s]` or `[0sec:4sec]` seconds.
- `[0:05:0:10]` timecode-style seconds, from 0:05 to 0:10.

Use the same unit for the start and end of a range. Cover the clip without gaps when the intended story is continuous. Short overlap at boundaries is handled softly, so adjacent segments should describe compatible motion.

For sliding windows and video continuation, frame 1 and `0%` refer to the first non-overlap frame that will remain in the final output for that window. Earlier overlap frames are only used for continuity and are discarded.

Prompt Relay syntax does not change **How to Process each Line of the Text Prompt**. It is recommended to enable "Each new Paragraph separated by an Empty Line" to avoid auto splitting of your prompt in multiple independent prompts.

Example:

```text
Epic cinematic fantasy battle, a lone armored knight faces a massive black dragon in a ruined mountain keep at dusk, smoke, sparks, torn banners, dramatic firelight, coherent action continuity, grounded physical motion.
[0%:25%] The knight raises a dented shield as the dragon lands among broken stones, wings throwing dust across the courtyard while embers swirl between them.
[25%:50%] The dragon lunges and breathes fire across the ground while the knight rolls under the flame, rises beside a shattered pillar, and shouts "By oath and steel, I will not yield."
[50%:75%] The knight charges through smoke, climbs onto fallen masonry, and drives the glowing sword toward the dragon's exposed chest as the beast rears back for one last attack.
[75%:] The blade strikes true, the dragon collapses in a wave of sparks and ash, and the exhausted knight lowers the sword and whispers "Rest now, ancient terror."
