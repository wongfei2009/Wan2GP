HUM_INFOS = """**Turn a hummed melody into a new song.** Upload a clear human hum (10–30 seconds is a useful starting point), enter the words to sing in **Lyrics**, and describe the genre, instruments and voice in **Music Style**.

**Continue Hum** uses your melody as the opening of a longer composition. **Hum Only** keeps the transcribed score without extending it; this does not guarantee an exact waveform duration. Both modes also use the hum's pitch contour and timing during audio synthesis. Transcription errors can change notes. This creates a new performance; it does not clone your voice or preserve the input recording.

Start with 32 synthesis steps and guidance 1. Guidance controls the lyrics/style conditioning, not a separate hum strength. Maximum Song Duration caps the result; it does not force that length. The song can end sooner, and a short cap can cut it off. Change the seed for another interpretation. Use an isolated hum rather than a full mixed song. No manual ABC score or direct-generation mode is offered for this finetune.

**Save ABC and MIDI Score** exports the composition used for generation. For Continue Hum, this includes the generated continuation. Abort cancels; Early Stop renders the audio tokens already composed. The included acoustic LoRA is required and already incorporates Mothersuperior's real-audio v4 LoRA; do not add that LoRA again.

INFOS = """**Turn your lyrics into a complete song** with a singing voice and accompaniment, in stereo.

- **Lyrics** supplies the words to sing. **Music Style** describes how the song should sound. Use both for your first song.
- **Melody and chords** is the recommended starting point: YuE2 plans the tune and its harmony before making the recording.
- **Melody only** plans the tune while giving the accompaniment more freedom. Use this when a supplied melody should keep its shape but the arrangement can change.
- **Direct generation** skips the written composition plan. Try it for an alternative interpretation of the same lyrics and style.

**Start with the defaults.** Write one or two short verses and a repeated chorus, choose a clear style, and allow enough time for the words. **Maximum Song Duration is an upper limit, not a requested song length. YuE2 can stop earlier when it considers the song finished.** Increasing the limit allows more time but does not force a longer song; a limit that is too short can cut it off. A very large limit is capped by the model's capacity, which also depends on the length of your lyrics and score. Change the seed to try another performance. More synthesis steps cost more time; 32 is the recommended starting point.

**Abort** cancels the generation without saving a partial song. **Early Stop** stops audio-token generation and renders what has already been composed.

**LoRAs:** select compatible YuE2 acoustic-model LoRAs in the LoRAs tab. Start with multiplier 1; lower it for a weaker effect. They affect the audio rendering after composition and audio-token generation. AR planner LoRAs are not supported by this loader.

**Optional prompt enhancer:** disabled by default. Choose Lyrics to turn an idea into singable words or tidy existing lyrics; choose Music Style to clarify the sound, or Lyrics then Music Style to prepare both. Review the result before generating. The enhancer does not edit your ABC score.

**Optional ABC score:** upload a UTF-8 `.abc` file if you already have a compatible written melody or composition. Otherwise leave the file input empty for automatic planning. ABC is a text format for musical notation, not a place for instructions such as “make it happier.” Supplying a score replaces the automatic plan. It requires Melody and chords or Melody only; melody-only scores must omit chord symbols. The supported score format uses Vocal and Ins voices. A score and lyrics that belong together give the model clearer guidance.

**Save ABC and MIDI Score:** turn this on to save both `.abc` and `.mid` beside the song, using the same filename. This exports the planned, supplied or source-transcribed composition, not a transcription of the finished performance. The score can be longer than an early-stopped song. Direct generation has no score to export. Off by default.

Changing the lyrics, style or score creates a **new recording**; it does not preserve the original voice or keep parts of an existing recording untouched. Choose **Source Audio > Extract Score from Source Song** to transcribe a recording with SheetSage2/MERT2. Melody and chords retains harmony; Melody only leaves the new accompaniment more freedom. Direct generation cannot use source audio. The ABC file input is hidden and ignored while source audio is selected. You must still supply lyrics: transcription extracts musical notes, not sung words. Match the lyrics and section order to the source; transcription mistakes can affect the result. The model weights are **CC BY-NC 4.0 (non-commercial use)**.
"""
PROMPT_INFOS = """**Write lyrics, not a request to write them.** Put section labels on their own lines and leave a blank line between sections:

```text
[Verse]
Morning light across the bay
We watch the shadows drift away

[Chorus]
Stay with me until the dawn
Let our little song go on
```

Keep lines reasonably short and easy to sing. Repeat the actual chorus words when you want the chorus again; avoid long explanations between the lyrics.

If you want help writing lyrics from an idea, explicitly enable the Lyrics enhancer. With enhancement disabled, enter the lyrics themselves.

**Describe the sound in Music Style.** A useful description names the language, genre, main instruments, mood and kind of voice. Add a tempo if it matters:

```text
English acoustic pop, warm female vocal, fingerpicked guitar,
gentle drums, hopeful, 90 BPM
```

For a cover from source audio, enter the original lyrics separately and keep their verse/chorus order aligned with the source. The audio supplies notes, not a transcript of the words.
Enable **Save ABC and MIDI Score** to keep the composition for later editing or reuse; the saved score does not add lyrics automatically.
To reuse an ABC score, upload its `.abc` file under **Optional ABC Score**, select No Audio, and use Melody and chords or Melody only. Keep notation out of the lyrics and style fields.

Start with a few compatible ideas. “Gentle acoustic ballad” and “aggressive fast metal” pull in different directions. For a different arrangement, keep the lyrics and change the style; for a different performance, change the seed. If the ending is cut off, allow more time or shorten the lyrics. A style prompt describes the character of a voice; it does not guarantee a particular singer's identity.

- `model_mode`: **0** melody+chords (recommended), **1** melody only/free accompaniment, **2** direct generation.
- Optional `custom_guide`: path to a UTF-8 `.abc` score file, replacing planning in modes 0/1. Use Vocal/Ins voices and no chords for mode 1. Align the lyrics with the score. Omit for automatic planning; source audio hides and overrides this file. Old `custom_settings.abc` text is ignored.
- `custom_settings.save_score`: **0** off (default), **1** export both `.abc` and `.mid` with the song's filename. Exports the conditioning composition, not the finished performance; it may outlast a truncated song. Mode 2 exports neither. API artifacts return these side files in memory.
