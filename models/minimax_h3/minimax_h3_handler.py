"""

FL2VA_INFOS = """## FL2VA — First/Last Frame to Video and Audio

FL2VA creates a video with stereo sound from your text prompt. You can optionally provide a start image, an end image, a control video, injected frames, or a soundtrack.

### Start and end images

- **No image:** generate the video and audio from the text prompt.
- **Start image only:** begin the video with that image.
- **End image only:** finish the video with that image.
- **Start and end images:** guide both ends of the video.

Start and end images are placed at those exact points in the video. For general character, object, or style references, use Ref2VA instead.

### Control Video / Frames Injection

- **Generate without using a Control Video:** generate normally from the prompt and any start/end images.
- **Use Control Video as In-Context Guide:** H3 receives the control video's unchanged frames as `<Video 1>` and generates a new video from them. Choose this mode with LoRAs trained on FL2VA to transform a source video: name the video `<Video 1>` in the prompt and say what to change and what to keep. FL2VA is not trained to follow this input on its own; without such a LoRA, use Ref2VA with **Reference Video**.
- **Denoise Control Video (Video-to-Video Edit):** use an uploaded video to guide the result. Lower **Denoising Strength** values keep the result closer to the control video; `1.0` gives the model full freedom. At `1.0` with **Whole Frame** selected, the control video does not affect the result, so WanGP skips that work. Choose **Masked Area** or **Non Masked Area** to limit editing to part of the frame. **Masking Strength** controls how strongly the rest of the frame stays close to the control video. Use a lower masking strength (<0.75) to facilitate continuity with masked areas.
- **Inject Frames:** add images at specific points in the generated video. Add the images under **Reference Images**, then enter one position per image in the same order. Position `1` means the first frame; `L` means the last frame of a sliding-window segment. Each `X` skips a window without consuming an image. An injected frame on a window's first or last frame acts as that window's start or end image; one inside the sliding-window overlap is not used, because the overlap already continues the previous window.

Both control video modes are split across sliding windows: each window receives only its own section of the control video. For motion or appearance transfer from a video reference, use Ref2VA with **Reference Video**.

### Audio Source

- **Generate Video and Audio from Text Prompt:** let H3 create both.
- **Generate Video based on Soundtrack and Text Prompt (Soundtrack Kept):** upload a soundtrack and H3 will create the video around it. If the soundtrack covers the whole video, WanGP uses the original audio in the final file. If it ends early, H3 generates the remaining sound.
- **Generate Video based on Control Video + its Audio Track and Text Prompt (Soundtrack Kept):** select one of the control video modes. H3 uses both its frames and its existing audio track, which is kept as the soundtrack like an uploaded one; with **Denoise Control Video**, the visual changes follow the denoising and mask settings.
- **Generate Audio based on Control Video and Text Prompt:** select **Denoise Control Video**. WanGP keeps the control video's frames unchanged and asks H3 to create a new soundtrack.

For visible speech in soundtrack mode, identify the character and explicitly request synchronized speaking, for example `The woman is speaking with natural lip movements synchronized.` You do not need to write the spoken words or mention a supplied audio track. See the prompt guidance for examples; supplying speech alone does not guarantee visible speaking or exact lip sync.

### Longer videos

Sliding windows can continue a video beyond one generation. Choose any overlap amount and WanGP will round it to the nearest H3-compatible value (1, 18, 35, 52...). It automatically reuses the overlapping video and audio to make the join smoother.

H3 is designed for 24 FPS, although WanGP can generate at another frame rate. MiniMax documents an official duration of 4–15 seconds per generation window; longer videos are possible through sliding windows.
"""

REF2VA_DEEPY_INFOS = """Generate video and 32 kHz stereo audio from `prompt` and references. Ordered `image_refs` guide identity, objects or setting; reference flags in `video_prompt_type`: `I` preserves chosen output dimensions, `KI` derives them from the first image. `image_start` / `image_end` are timeline anchors shown before general image references. `FI` injects the first `image_refs` at `frames_positions` (`1` = first frame, `L` = window end, `X` = skip a window); remaining images are references; not with `GV`. Per window, pictures are numbered: start or continued frame (`<Picture 1>`), end image, that window's injected frames by time, then references. `video_source` and sliding windows provide continuation.

`video_guide`, `video_guide2` and `video_guide3` supply up to three reference videos for appearance, motion or camera; choose the corresponding video mode. `V1-U` instead takes up to three excerpts from `video_guide` at `custom_settings.h3_video_excerpt_positions`: frame numbers or seconds such as `5.2s`, each optionally followed by `/duration` (default 3s), for example `3 5.2s/4s 12s`. Reference videos preserve the chosen output size and are given whole to every sliding window. Control videos (`VU`, `GV`) use the control video's aspect ratio and are split across sliding windows, each window receiving its own section. Use Reference Video for motion transfer to image-reference characters; for depth, pose or edge control use the MiniMax H3 FL2VA ControlNet-Union model. `VU` supplies the control video's unchanged frames as `<Video 1>`: an in-context guide for LoRAs that transform a source video, such as character swap; name it `<Video 1>` in the prompt and state what to do with it. `GV` (Denoise Control Video) edits through denoising: lower strength preserves more source content; at strength 1 without a mask, the source supplies no visual conditioning. `GV` does not supply a video reference.

`audio_prompt_type`: empty = no audio input. References, whose voice or sound H3 reuses in newly generated audio: `A` = `audio_guide`, `AB` = two audio guides, `ABD` = three audio guides, `K` = reference-video soundtracks (not with excerpts);  `K1` = up to three soundtrack excerpts at `custom_settings.h3_audio_excerpt_positions`, same syntax, independent of the video excerpts; the prompt defines each reference's role. Soundtrack, kept as the output audio and followed by the video across sliding windows: `AS` = `audio_guide`, `KS` = the whole audio track of the reference video or of a control video (`GV`, `VU`). `K` / `K1` need reference videos (`K1` a single one or excerpts from one); `KS` also accepts a control video. A kept soundtrack is not a reference: give it no <Audio N> label.

Limits: 9 reference images (injected frames not counted); 3 videos, each at least 2s, a `VU` control counting as one but split per window instead of trimmed; one reference video keeps its first 15s (362 frames), and videos above 15s combined keep an equal share each (7.3s for two, 4.5s for three); 3 audio references, each at least 2s. Audio above 15s combined is split evenly: 15s for one reference, 7.5s each for two, 5s each for three. Image + video reference count must cover audio reference count. At most 12 uploaded reference files; a video soundtrack shares its video's file. Keep backgrounds when scene context matters; optional background removal isolates subjects. Read `prompt_infos` for Ref2VA's six-section syntax.
"""

REF2VA_INFOS = """## Ref2VA — Reference to Video and Audio

Ref2VA generates a new video with native 32 kHz stereo audio from text plus multimodal references. Images can guide identity, appearance, or scene content; video can guide content, appearance, and motion; audio can guide or reuse sound and voice. A reference video is contextual material, not a guaranteed frame-exact continuation constraint.

### Reference limits

- **Images:** up to 9. Injected frames are not counted.
- **Videos:** up to 3 clips, each at least 2 seconds long. An in-context control video counts as one of them, but it is split across sliding windows instead of being trimmed. A single reference video keeps its first 15 seconds (362 frames). When several videos total more than 15 seconds, each keeps an equal share: about 7.3 seconds for two and 4.5 seconds for three. A reference video's soundtrack is trimmed with its video.
- **Audio:** up to 3 inputs, each at least 2 seconds long. When their combined duration exceeds 15 seconds, WanGP splits the 15 seconds evenly: 15 seconds for one reference, 7.5 seconds each for two, 5 seconds each for three.
- **Audio requires matching visual references:** the combined number of reference images and videos must be at least the number of reference audio clips.
- **Video soundtracks:** selecting reference-video soundtracks uses one audio-reference slot per selected video; soundtrack excerpts use one slot per excerpt. Each video excerpt counts as one reference video. A soundtrack shares its video's uploaded file, so it does not add another file to the mixed-input count.
- **Mixed references:** at most 12 files across images, videos, and audio.

### Audio Source

- **Generate without an Audio Reference:** H3 creates the sound from the prompt.
- **Use One / Two / Three Audio References:** H3 reuses the voice or sound of each uploaded audio in newly generated audio. Name them `<Audio 1>` to `<Audio 3>` in the prompt and state their role.
- **Use Reference Videos Soundtrack(s) as Audio References:** the same, using each reference video's audio track. Not available with excerpts: use the soundtrack excerpt choice below.
- **Use Up to 3 Excerpts from Reference-Video Soundtrack:** takes audio references from the reference video's soundtrack at the positions entered in **Audio Reference Positions**, independently of any video excerpts. Requires a single reference video or excerpts from one.
- **Generate Video based on Soundtrack and Text Prompt (Soundtrack Kept):** upload a speech or music track that must be heard exactly as it is. H3 creates the video around it and WanGP keeps the original audio in the final file, in sync across sliding windows.
- **Generate Video based on Reference / Control Video + its Audio Track and Text Prompt (Soundtrack Kept):** the same, using the whole audio track of the reference video or of the control video. A reference video (or its excerpts) still guides appearance and motion; a control video (in-context or denoised) drives the generation in sync with its own audio. Requires a single reference video, excerpts from one, or a control video.

A kept soundtrack is not a reference: do not mention a supplied audio track or assign it an `<Audio N>` label in the prompt. For visible speech, identify the character and include `speaking with natural lip movements synchronized` or equivalent lip-sync wording. No transcript is required; see the prompt guidance for examples.

### Excerpts from one Reference Video

Select **Use Up to 3 Excerpts from same Reference Video** to take up to three moments from one longer video instead of uploading separate clips. Enter them in **Reference Positions from Control Video** as frame numbers or seconds, separated by spaces or commas. Each position is the centre of an excerpt lasting 3 seconds unless a duration follows a slash:

- `3 5s 12s`: three 3-second excerpts around frame 3, 5 seconds, and 12 seconds.
- `3/4s 5.2s/3s 12s/2.5s`: the same moments with individual durations.

Each excerpt lasts at least 2 seconds, the excerpts total at most 15 seconds, and an excerpt near the start or end of the video is moved inward to keep its duration. Each excerpt counts as one reference video; name them `<Video 1>` to `<Video 3>` in order.

### Choosing a video input

- **Reference Video:** reuse subjects, appearance, or motion without changing the selected output resolution. Choose this mode to transfer motion from a video to characters supplied in reference images; describe the subject replacements in the prompt. Reference videos do not use Denoising Strength.
- **Use Control Video as In-Context Guide:** H3 receives the control video's unchanged frames as `<Video 1>` and generates a new video from them. Choose this mode for LoRAs that transform a source video, such as a character swap: name the video `<Video 1>` in the prompt and say what to change and what to keep. Without such a LoRA, it behaves like a Reference Video that follows the control video section by section.
- **Denoise Control Video (Video-to-Video Edit):** edit the source video using the prompt and **Denoising Strength**. Lower strength preserves more source content. At `1.0` with **Whole Frame** selected, the source video supplies no visual conditioning. Choose **Masked Area** or **Non Masked Area** to edit part of the frame. This mode does not supply the video as a motion/appearance reference.

Reference videos adapt to your chosen output size and guide the result creatively, without guaranteeing exact motion reproduction. Each sliding window receives the whole reference video (up to its first 15 seconds).

To follow a video's depth, pose, edges or shapes, use the **MiniMax H3 FL2VA ControlNet-Union** model instead.

Control videos define the output size and are split across sliding windows: each window receives only its own section, so a long control video can drive a long generation. A window can be longer than 15 seconds; MiniMax documents 4–15 seconds per window, so longer windows may lose quality.

### Reference-image size

The reference-image selector can preserve the selected output dimensions or use the first reference image to define them. In **Advanced Mode**, **Rescale Internaly Image Ref (% in relation to Output Video) to change Output Composition** controls each reference image's internal pixel budget while preserving its aspect ratio. **100%** matches the output video's pixel budget. Higher values can preserve more reference detail and improve fidelity, but generation is slower; lower values are faster but can lose fine details. This setting does not change the output resolution after it has been selected or derived.

### Background removal

Background removal is disabled by default. After selecting reference images, use **Automatic Removal of Background behind People or Objects in Reference Images** when you want WanGP to isolate people or objects before sending the images to H3. Keep backgrounds when the surrounding scene is part of the reference you want H3 to follow.

### Start/end images and longer videos

Ref2VA also supports optional start and end images. These are shown to the prompt before the general reference images: with a start image and one reference image, the start image is `<Picture 1>` and the reference image is `<Picture 2>`.

### Injected frames

Select **Inject Frames at chosen Positions** in **Reference Images** to place images at exact moments of the video, and enter one position per image under **Positions of Injected Frames**: `1` is the first frame, `L` the last frame of a sliding-window segment, and `X` skips a window without consuming an image. Add the injected images first; any images beyond the positions are ordinary reference images for identity, objects or style. Injected frames combine with reference videos and in-context control videos, but not with **Denoise Control Video**. The output size follows the first injected image unless a control video defines it.

An injected frame on a window's first or last frame acts as that window's start or end image; one inside the sliding-window overlap is not used, because the overlap already continues the previous window. In each window, pictures are numbered in this order: the start image or the frame continued from the previous window (`<Picture 1>`), the end image, the injected frames of that window in time order, then the reference images. The numbering restarts in every window, so describe each window separately when injected frames or reference images change the count, and declare each injected frame at its time in the window.

For longer videos, choose any sliding-window overlap amount and WanGP will round it to the nearest H3-compatible value (1, 18, 35, 52...). It automatically carries the overlapping video and audio into the next window while keeping the selected references available.

H3 is designed for 24 FPS, although WanGP can generate at another frame rate. MiniMax documents an official duration of 4–15 seconds per generation window; longer videos are possible through sliding windows.

CONTROL_INFOS = f"""## FL2VA ControlNet-Union — Control Video to Video and Audio

This model adds the VideoX-Fun ControlNet-Union 2.0 branch to MiniMax H3 FL2VA. A control video drives the structure and motion of the generated video, while the text prompt defines its content, style and sound. The output takes the control video's aspect ratio and H3 still generates synchronized stereo sound.

### Control Video

- **Transfer Human Motion:** WanGP extracts an Open Pose skeleton from the control video. Use it to animate new characters with the same body movements.
- **Transfer Depth:** a depth map keeps the scene layout, camera movement and object placement while the prompt restyles everything.
- **Transfer Canny Edges:** fine outlines preserve shapes and silhouettes closely; this is the strictest structural guide.
- **Transfer Shapes:** softer scribble-like outlines keep the overall composition with more freedom for details.
- **Recolorize:** a grayscale version of the video keeps its lighting and content; describe the colors in the prompt.
- **Use Control Video as is:** normally, upload an already prepared control map (Pose, Depth, Canny, HED, MLSD, Scribble, Layout or Gray). With **Spatial Outpainting** enabled, supply the original video instead: its picture is kept as context while ControlNet generates the new borders. No Video Mask is needed for border expansion alone.
- **Perform Inpainting:** regenerate only the masked area of the video from the prompt, without a control map.

**Control Strength** scales the control branch: `1.0` follows the control video closely, lower values give the prompt more freedom and `0` disables it.

### Masks

With a Video Mask, only the masked area is regenerated and follows the control map, while the rest of the source video is kept as a reference for the model. The kept area is guided rather than copied pixel for pixel, so fine details can still drift. Masks require one of the preprocessing modes above, or **Use Control Video as is** with Spatial Outpainting enabled, because WanGP needs the original video to know what to keep.

### Spatial Outpainting

Select **Use Control Video as is**, supply the original video, enable **Spatial Outpainting**, then set the top, bottom, left and right expansion or choose a target aspect ratio. Describe the complete scene and the surroundings you want to add. The requested resolution is the final expanded canvas; use a larger resolution if you want to retain the source's detail.

The original rectangle is visible context for ControlNet's inpainting branch, and the new borders are automatically masked for generation. This uses ControlNet conditioning; **Denoising Strength** and **Mask Denoising Mode** from ordinary FL2VA are not used. **Control Strength** controls how strongly the visible context guides the result. The original area can still change slightly.

To also edit an area inside the original picture, add a Video Mask or select **Perform Inpainting** with a mask, then enable Spatial Outpainting. Pose, depth, edge, shape and grayscale modes can likewise combine expansion with an explicit mask; their unmasked area supplies the original picture. For outpainting with **Use Control Video as is**, upload the original RGB video rather than a pose/depth/edge map. Sliding windows extend each matching source-video section. {CONTROL_CONTINUATION_INFOS} The original picture remains guidance and can still change.

### Start / End Images, Continuation and Audio

A start image, an end image or a video to continue can be combined with the control video. H3 anchors those frames while the control branch drives the rest; the control model was trained without such anchors, so keep them consistent with the control video (for example the first frame of the source video). Sliding windows split long control videos: each window receives its own section.

- **Generate Video and Audio from Text Prompt:** H3 creates new sound matching the prompt and motion.
- **Generate Video based on Soundtrack and Text Prompt:** an uploaded soundtrack is kept and the video follows it.
- **Generate Video based on Control Video + its Audio Track:** keep the control video's own soundtrack, for example the music of a dance video.

A kept soundtrack stays in the saved output, but visible speech also depends on the prompt and the pose guide. Identify the character and explicitly request synchronized speaking, for example `The woman is speaking with natural lip movements synchronized.` You do not need to write the spoken words or mention a supplied audio track. A pose guide showing a still mouth or a lowered face can compete with speaking motion; keeping the soundtrack does not guarantee exact lip sync.

### Recommended settings

The branch is guidance-distilled: keep **Guidance** at 1. Upstream demonstrations use 40 steps; 20 steps already give usable results. Keep each window within 15 seconds (362 frames), the duration the control branch was trained on. Two-phase generation and text-to-image are not available with this model.

- **Two Phases:** use it for faster high-resolution generation and improved fine detail. Most of the work is performed at a lower resolution before H3 enhances the result at the selected output resolution. This mode does not reduce the peak VRAM required by the final enhancement.
- **Two Phases with Tiling:** use it when regular two-phase generation runs out of VRAM. It processes the final enhancement as four overlapping areas, reducing peak VRAM at the cost of extra processing time and a possible risk of visible seams or local inconsistencies.

Start with the default **Phase 2 Noise Level Start**. Lower it to keep the result closer to the first phase and favor smoother tile blending; raise it to encourage stronger new details, with a greater risk of seams or changes between tiles.
"""

H3_PHASE_TURBO_INFOS = """
WanGP manages the required phase-two Turbo LoRA automatically. Other selected Turbo LoRAs are disabled during phase two to avoid conflicts, while non-Turbo LoRAs retain their selected phase-two multiplier.
"""

H3_SPEED_INFOS = """
### Speed and memory choices

Enable **Advanced Mode** to access these options:

- **Spectrum:** in **Steps Skipping**, select **Spectrum Feature Forecasting**. Spectrum captures an accelerated local-only trajectory, retains its actual-step anchors in system RAM, then performs a transformer-free smoothing replay with independent video and audio prediction. Keep the default 25% start for five full warmup steps in a 20-step generation; increasing it starts later and skips fewer steps. Short Euler schedules can bootstrap after their first actual step, while RES Multistep preserves a three-step actual tail.
- **First Block Cache:** in **Steps Skipping**, select **First Block Cache**. It runs the first transformer block to decide whether the remaining blocks can reuse their previous result. The balanced strength uses the upstream 0.08 threshold; higher strengths skip more work but can change motion or fine details. The displayed strength is not an exact speed multiplier.
"""

H3_STANDARD_SAMPLER_INFOS = """
- **Ralston 2S:** in **Sampler Solver / Scheduler**, select **Ralston 2S** to use the anchored deterministic second-order Runge-Kutta sampler. It evaluates H3 at the start and two-thirds point of every interval, anchors the second prediction to the interval start, then combines both predictions with Ralston's `1/4, 3/4` weights. This can reduce numerical integration error and may improve fine-detail retention, motion stability, and audio/video coherence. Perceptual improvements are prompt-dependent and are not guaranteed. Its second prediction depends on the first, so they cannot run in parallel: Ralston performs two full transformer predictions per step and sampling is approximately **2x slower** than Euler or RES Multistep at the same step count. Spectrum Feature Forecasting is unsupported with Ralston 2S.
"""

H3_AUDIO_REFINEMENT_INFOS = """
### Audio Refinement Extra Phase

Use **Audio Refinement Extra Phase** to improve the soundtrack after video generation without LoRAs. WanGP preserves the completed video latent exactly, partially re-noises the existing audio latent at 0.5 denoising strength, and runs a few additional audio steps before decoding both streams. Keeping the original full-resolution video and audio latents preserves fine lip motion and the first pass's timing. This extra phase runs after all video phases, so it is the second phase after normal generation and the third phase after two-phase video generation.

When enabled, the refinement uses 6 extra steps at 0.5 denoising strength.

The extra phase uses the text prompt and the locked final video only. Reference images, reference video or audio, Control Video, and selected LoRAs are not injected again. Each extra step still processes the full-resolution packed sequence so that audio can attend to the video; the video output of those steps is discarded. FL2VA hides this option when an input soundtrack controls the result, and PDD variants do not offer it because their denoising schedule is fixed to 8 steps.
"""

H3_COMMON_RUNTIME_INFOS = """
- **Sol-Attn:** in **Advanced Mode > Misc. > Override Attention Mode**, select **sol**. The **Start Tau** slider then appears below the attention selector and shows that End Tau is fixed at `0.8`. H3 defaults to `1.3`; this value is used on the first denoising step and decreases linearly to `0.8` on the final step. Use `1.0` for the Sol-Attn paper starting value, increase it to route more attention blocks through the approximate path for greater speed, or lower it for denser attention and higher fidelity. It uses sparse attention only on large visual sequences and requires BF16, Triton 3.6 or newer, and a CUDA NVIDIA GPU using SM86, SM89, SM90, SM100, SM120, or SM121 (such as RTX 30/40/50-series, H100/H200, B100/B200, or DGX Spark); the dropdown reports whether it is available on the current system.
- **Text Encoder:** at the bottom of **Misc.**, use the **Text Encoder** configuration to reduce system RAM. **Qwen3-VL BF16** uses the most memory; **Quanto INT8** is a balanced lower-memory choice; **NVFP4 AWQ**, **GGUF Q4_K_M**, and especially **GGUF Q2_K** reduce it further. More aggressive quantization can slightly affect prompt interpretation.
- **Priority:** beside the Text Encoder configuration, choose which memory limit matters most. **Lower VRAM** uses all code optimizations and reduces greatly VRAM consumption while **Lower RAM** uses only VRAM optimizations that doesnt consume extra RAM.
"""

H3_AUDIO_GENERATOR_INFOS = """## MiniMax H3 audio generator

This audio-only preset reuses the pruned Ref2VA checkpoint. H3 still jointly denoises a tiny 32x32 video internally, but WanGP skips the video decode and saves only the generated 32 kHz stereo audio.

- **No reference:** generate speech, ambience, Foley, or music from the prompt alone.
- **One audio reference:** use `<Audio 1>` in the prompt to describe the voice, delivery, music, or sound characteristics to retain.
- **Two or three audio references:** use `<Audio 1>` to `<Audio 3>` independently, for example as cloned speaker voices.
- Each reference must be at least 2 seconds long. Above a combined 15 seconds, the 15 seconds are split evenly: 15 seconds for one reference, 7.5 seconds each for two, 5 seconds each for three.
- **Maximum Total Audio Duration** is the cumulative limit for the assembled monologue or dialogue. Each speaker turn is generated separately; individual segments above H3's official 15-second range remain experimental.
- **Early Stop** finishes the H3 segment currently being generated, then assembles and returns all completed segments.

H3 remains an audiovisual model even though this preset discards the video. A structured H3 prompt that describes the hidden scene and binds each speaker to a stable ID such as `(S1)` or `(S2)` can improve audio coherence. Put exact dialogue inside `<d>[Language] ...</d>`.
