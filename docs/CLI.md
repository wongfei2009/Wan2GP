# Command Line Reference

This document covers current command line options for WanGP. Deprecated Wan model-selection shortcuts remain accepted for existing launch scripts, but are omitted from command help.

## Basic Usage

```bash
# Default launch
python wgp.py

```

## Deepy: Gradio, CLI or Web

Choose one access mode per launch, using your saved Deepy configuration:

```bash
# Gradio at / and the synchronized mobile Web app at /deepy/
python wgp.py --listen

# Interactive terminal chat, without Gradio
python wgp.py --ask-deepy

# Standalone browser app, accessible on the local network
python wgp.py --deepy-server --listen --server-port 7860
```

Gradio includes the Web app at `http://<PC-address>:7860/deepy/`; standalone Web serves it at `http://<PC-address>:7860/`. In a Gradio launch, both interfaces share chat, galleries, selections, settings and active work. Chat and generations continue with every browser closed. Authentication is disabled by default; `--auth` enables a shared password login for Gradio and Deepy. On smartphones the app uses native keyboard dictation. Separate launches do not attach to another process; use saved sessions when moving between processes.

Common Deepy launch options:

| Option | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `--config FOLDER` | Configuration folder containing `wgp_config.json` |
| `--deepy-sessions-dir FOLDER` | Persistent-session location; see [session storage](#deepy-session-location) |
| `--output-dir FOLDER` | Override image, video and audio output folders in CLI or Web mode |
| `--deepy-voice-language CODE` | Overrides the configured microphone transcription language in Gradio or Web; `fr`, `en`, etc., or `auto` for detection |
| `--debug-deepy FOLDER` | Deepy debug logs |
| `--llm-io FOLDER` | LLM input/output transcripts; see [LLM I/O Transcript](#llm-io-transcript) |

Shared network protection options:

| Option | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `--auth` | Enable password-only login for Gradio and Deepy; generate a password when none is supplied |
| `--no-auth` | Explicitly disable web authentication; this is the default |
| `--auth-password PASSPHRASE` | Fixed web passphrase; requires `--auth`. Environment alternative: `WANGP_AUTH_PASSWORD` |
| `--public-url ORIGIN` | Optional exact browser-origin restriction, e.g. `https://wangp.example.com`. Also supports proxies that rewrite the backend Host. A normal HTTPS-to-HTTP proxy with the public Host preserved needs no option. Applies to Gradio and Deepy, with or without `--auth` |
| `--mcp-auth` | Enable separate OAuth authorization for network MCP |
| `--mcp-auth-password PASSPHRASE` | Fixed MCP approval passphrase; requires `--mcp-auth`. Environment alternative: `WANGP_MCP_AUTH_PASSWORD` |
| `--mcp-auth-url ORIGIN` | Public MCP server origin, such as `https://wangp.example.com:7866`; required with `--mcp-auth` |
| `--ssl-certfile FILE`, `--ssl-keyfile FILE` | Certificate and private key for any web/HTTP MCP launch; environment alternatives: `WANGP_SSL_CERT`, `WANGP_SSL_KEY` |
| `--https-port PORT` | Serve HTTPS on this port and redirect the main HTTP port; requires the certificate and key |

The authentication and certificate flags no longer use Deepy-specific names. Authentication remains off unless enabled. See [Authentication, HTTPS, and Reverse Proxies](AUTHENTICATION.md) for web login, `--public-url` examples, certificates, and MCP OAuth setup.

See the [Deepy guide](DEEPY.md) for initial configuration and [interactive CLI commands](DEEPY.md#cli-mode).

## CLI Queue Processing (Headless Mode)

Process saved queues without launching the web UI. Useful for batch processing or automated workflows.

### Quick Start
```bash
# Process a saved queue (ZIP with attachments)
python wgp.py --process my_queue.zip

# Process a settings file (JSON)
python wgp.py --process my_settings.json

# Validate without generating (dry-run)
python wgp.py --process my_queue.zip --dry-run

# Process with custom output directory
python wgp.py --process my_queue.zip --output-dir ./batch_outputs
```

### Supported File Formats
| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `.zip` | Full queue with embedded attachments (images, videos, audio). Created via "Save Queue" button. |
| `.json` | Settings file only. Media paths are used as-is (absolute or relative to WanGP folder). Created via "Export Settings" button. |

### Workflow
1. **Create your queue** in the web UI using the normal interface
2. **Save the queue** using the "Save Queue" button (creates a .zip file)
3. **Close the web UI** if desired
4. **Process the queue** via command line:
   ```bash
   python wgp.py --process saved_queue.zip --output-dir ./my_outputs
   ```

### CLI Queue Options
```bash
--process PATH          # Path to queue (.zip) or settings (.json) file (enables headless mode)
--dry-run               # Validate file without generating (use with --process)
--output-dir PATH       # Override output directory (use with --process)
--verbose LEVEL         # Verbosity level 0-2 for detailed logging
```

### Console Output
The CLI mode provides real-time feedback:
```
WanGP CLI Mode - Processing queue: my_queue.zip
Output directory: ./batch_outputs
Loaded 3 task(s)

[Task 1/3] A beautiful sunset over the ocean...
  [12/30] Prompt 1/3 - Denoising | Phase 2/2 Low Noise
  Video saved
  Task 1 completed

[Task 2/3] A cat playing with yarn...
  [30/30] Prompt 2/3 - VAE Decoding
  Video saved
  Task 2 completed

==================================================
Queue completed: 3/3 tasks in 5m 23s
```

### Exit Codes
| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success (all tasks completed) |
| 1 | Error (file not found, invalid queue, or task failures) |
| 130 | Interrupted by user (Ctrl+C) |

## MCP Server

```bash
--mcp                              # Start WanGP as an MCP server without the web UI
--mcp-transport TRANSPORT          # stdio, sse, or streamable-http
--mcp-host HOST                    # Host for HTTP transports
--mcp-port PORT                    # Port for HTTP transports
--mcp-api-version {1,2}            # WanGP API contract; latest (2) by default, 1 for compatibility
--mcp-async                        # Permit wait=false in v2; disabled by default
--mcp-console-output               # Mirror WanGP output while serving MCP
--mcp-allow-read-file-system       # Allow agents to submit arbitrary server file paths (disabled by default)
```

Media IDs returned by the Gallery remain usable when filesystem reads are disabled. Streamable HTTP and SSE servers also expose short-lived Gallery upload/download URLs; stdio does not provide HTTP media transfer.

The default MCP interface is now v2. Existing clients that use historical tool names or parameters must launch with `python wgp.py --mcp --mcp-api-version 1`. Use `--mcp-api-version 2` to pin v2 explicitly. Both `--mcp-api-version` and `--mcp-async` also work with `python -m shared.mcp_server`. The number selects the WanGP tool API, not the MCP protocol version; unsupported numbers are rejected. API v1 retains its original wait behavior. In v2, generation and post-processing wait by default; `--mcp-async` enables optional asynchronous calls without changing that default. See [API migration](API.md#mcp-api-v2-and-migration).

### Examples
```bash
# Overnight batch processing
python wgp.py --process overnight_jobs.zip --output-dir ./renders

# Quick validation before long run
python wgp.py --process big_queue.zip --dry-run

# Verbose mode for debugging
python wgp.py --process my_queue.zip --verbose 2

# Combined with other options
python wgp.py --process queue.zip --output-dir ./out --attention sage2
```

## LLM I/O Transcript

```bash
--llm-io FOLDER                     # Record local and remote LLM traffic as a readable plain-text transcript
```

WanGP creates a timestamped `.log` file in the supplied folder. Each record is labelled `[OUT → LLM]` or `[IN ← LLM]` and identifies the engine and stream. Text is preserved verbatim; known special tokens include their names and numeric IDs, while other token streams use numeric IDs. Binary media is described by its source, type, dimensions, and size instead of being written as encoded data.

The transcript can contain prompts, conversation history, tool arguments/results, and model output. Enable it only while diagnosing a problem and treat the resulting file as private data.

## Deepy Session Location

```bash
--deepy-sessions-dir FOLDER          # Override the persistent Deepy sessions folder
```

The default is `deepy_sessions` in the WanGP installation root. The folder is created just in time, only after multi-session mode is enabled and Deepy receives its first request (or when a session archive is explicitly imported).

Each materialized session keeps its canonical decoder context in `context.json` and an append-only `cards.jsonl` journal of consolidated Web-client commands. Streaming token fragments are not written: a thought, response section, or tool card is journaled once it reaches a safe completed boundary, then those commands are replayed when the session is resumed. During replay, the Web client keeps the transcript hidden and suppresses per-command layout, disclosure, animation, and scroll work before one final refresh.

## Model and Performance Options

### Model Configuration
```bash
--quantize-transformer BOOL   # Enable/disable transformer quantization (default: True)
--compile                     # Enable PyTorch compilation (requires Triton)
--attention MODE              # Force attention mode: sdpa, flash, sage, sage2
--profile NUMBER              # Performance profile 1-5 (default: 4)
--preload NUMBER              # Preload N MB of diffusion model in VRAM (Manual VRAM Preload for every kind of output)
--fp16                        # Force fp16 instead of bf16 models
--save-quantized              # Save an INT8 Quanto checkpoint during model loading
--convrot                     # With --save-quantized, save INT8 ConvRot instead of Quanto INT8
--gpu DEVICE                  # Run on specific GPU device (e.g., "cuda:1")
```

### Performance Profiles
- **Profile 1**: each model loaded whole in VRAM, all models kept in Reserved RAM. The fastest generations and model switches, needs the most RAM and VRAM
- **Profile 2**: all models kept in Reserved RAM, sent to the GPU part by part. Runs models larger than your VRAM, leaves VRAM for long videos or large images and switches models fast, needs a lot of RAM
- **Profile 3**: each model loaded whole in VRAM, only the main models kept in Reserved RAM. Fast generations with less RAM, needs enough VRAM for the whole model
- **Profile 3+** (3.5, recommended for audio models): Profile 3 without any Reserved RAM. Audio models are usually small enough to fit whole in VRAM, where the language models many of them include run much faster and can use the faster CUDA Graph or vLLM engines; models load more slowly
- **Profile 4** (recommended): only the main models kept in Reserved RAM, sent to the GPU part by part. The most versatile: runs models larger than your VRAM and leaves VRAM for long videos or large images
- **Profile 4+** (4.5): Profile 4 sending one part at a time. Saves up to about 1 GB of VRAM, slightly slower
- **Profile 5** (fail safe): almost no Reserved RAM, all models sent to the GPU part by part. For PCs short of RAM and VRAM, slower with short steps such as images

### Preloading Part of the Model in VRAM
With profiles 2, 4 and 5, models are transferred to the GPU block by block at every denoising step. Image models such as Flux have short steps, so with profile 4 these transfers, rather than the GPU computation, can set the speed. In *Configuration / RAM/VRAM Management*, a *VRAM Preload* choice next to the default memory profile of each kind of output (video, image and audio) decides how much of each model stays in VRAM, so that less is transferred at each step:
- *Default*: the memory profile's own choice.
- *Dynamic*: as much of each model as the generation leaves free, adapted as it goes (below).
- *Manual*: the amount set with the *VRAM Preload (MB)* slider shown below it, spread across the blocks of each model.

The choice is hidden for profiles 1, 3 and 3+, which load models entirely in VRAM. A memory profile chosen in the settings of a generation uses the VRAM Preload of its kind of output, and `--preload` sets a manual value for all three.

For Flux dev at 1024x1024, a manual 6000 MB shortened the profile 4 steps by about 22%, to within about 20% of profile 1, with about half of its peak VRAM. Preloading uses VRAM during denoising only: at this resolution it did not raise the peak VRAM, which the image decoding sets.

#### Dynamic VRAM Preload
*Dynamic* helps most where transfers set the speed: images and low resolutions, with short steps. Video steps are usually long enough to hide the transfers, so *Default* is about as fast for videos. It needs the *MMGP Optimized VRAM Allocator* ([VRAM Allocator](#vram-allocator), the default); with PyTorch's allocator, or with Profile 4+, which sends one part at a time, the profile default applies.

- The first step of a new resolution, frame count or denoising stage runs with the profile default (as with a preload of 0) and measures the VRAM that the generation itself needs. During the next step, the parts of the model that fit in the rest of the VRAM stay there as they are transferred, without extra transfers, and the following steps no longer transfer them. This shortens the steps that transfers slow down, such as images and low resolutions; when the whole model fits, the speed then matches Profile 1.
- When the *Reserved RAM for Pinning* cannot hold the whole model, the parts that are not pinned, the slowest to transfer, are the first kept in VRAM.
- Each denoising stage has its own preload: a low resolution first stage (LTX-2, two-pass H3) keeps more of the model in VRAM than the full resolution stage that follows, and each model of a two-model video generator (Wan 2.2) gets its own.
- What is measured is kept for each model until WanGP closes or its definitions are refreshed (for instance after a finetune is edited), and is measured again with another quantization. Later generations with the same settings skip the measuring step: from their second step, the model fills the free VRAM.
- If VRAM runs short anyway (another program took VRAM, or a later step needs more than the first), parts of the model that are quick to transfer leave the VRAM instead of an out of memory error, and the following steps of that resolution keep that much less in VRAM so that it does not happen again. The generated images and videos are the same as with a manual preload.
- The VRAM stays filled during denoising: other programs that need VRAM at the same time get less. Not used with compilation (*Compile Transformer Model*) or when `--preload` is set.

### Memory Management
```bash
--perc-reserved-mem-max FLOAT # Share of RAM that pinning may lock, as a fraction (0.4 = 40%)
```
Pinned ("reserved") RAM makes the transfers to the GPU fast, but nothing else can use it. *Configuration / RAM/VRAM Management / Reserved RAM for Pinning* sets the share of RAM that WanGP may pin, in percent (0 = automatic: 40% on Windows, 60% on Linux). `--perc-reserved-mem-max` takes precedence over this setting, which takes precedence over the `perc_reserved_mem_max` environment variable.

When the models do not all fit in it, WanGP reserves first the parts used at every step; with [Smart Memory Pinning](#smart-memory-pinning), the rest still reaches the GPU almost as fast, so a smaller share mostly costs speed on short steps.

### VRAM Allocator
```bash
--vram-allocator vmm_spill  # MMGP Optimized VRAM Allocator with RAM spilling (default)
--vram-allocator vmm        # MMGP Optimized VRAM Allocator, an out of memory error when no VRAM is left
--vram-allocator default    # PyTorch's allocator
```
The *MMGP Optimized VRAM Allocator* (*Configuration / RAM/VRAM Management / VRAM Allocator*, on by default) recycles more efficiently the VRAM that is no longer used, which lowers the peak VRAM of long videos, large images and Deepy, with the same outputs and speed:

| Workload | VRAM saved |
|---|---:|
| H3 1920x1088, 241 frames | about 5.4 GB |
| H3 1280x720, 241 frames | about 1.5 GB |
| Flux dev 1024x1024 (image decoding) | about 1.3 GB |
| Deepy, Bonsai 2 27B, 20K-token prompt | about 0.2 GB |

The gain grows with the resolution and duration. The setting applies when WanGP starts; `--vram-allocator` takes precedence over it. It works on Windows and Linux with PyTorch 2.3 or newer and NVIDIA GPUs; elsewhere, WanGP says so at startup and uses PyTorch's allocator. The VRAM used by other programs on the same GPU (another WanGP, ComfyUI, a game, a browser) is left to them; only when WanGP would otherwise run out of VRAM does it take the VRAM they are not using, which Windows then moves to system RAM. When the error happens anyway, its message shows the VRAM free on the whole GPU and for WanGP, how much more was needed, and why it was refused.

*With RAM Spilling* (the default), when VRAM runs out, what no longer fits goes to system RAM instead of stopping the generation: the steps that use it are much slower, but a generation slightly too large for your VRAM can finish. When that would leave less than a tenth of the RAM (at least 4 GB) available, the NVIDIA driver takes over on Windows and places what no longer fits in shared GPU memory, as it does with PyTorch's allocator: a generation that finishes with PyTorch's allocator also finishes with this one. On a GPU that also drives your display, the screen may flash or go black for a moment meanwhile, without affecting the generation. Without spilling (`vmm`), running out of VRAM stops the generation with an out of memory error, instead of slowly spilling into shared GPU memory as the NVIDIA driver otherwise does on Windows.

### RAM Allocator
```bash
--ram-allocator mmgp      # MMGP RAM Allocator (default)
--ram-allocator default   # PyTorch's CPU allocator
```
Same as *Configuration > RAM/VRAM Management > RAM Allocator*. PyTorch keeps the RAM of the CPU tensors it frees (decoded frames, converted weights, frames waiting to be saved) to reuse it later: after a generation or after a model is released, several GB can stay in use, and on Windows the *committed* memory shown by the Task Manager can grow up to twice what these tensors need. With the *MMGP RAM Allocator*, the RAM of the CPU tensors of 1 MB and more goes back to the system when the queue is done, when a model is released, and whenever the RAM runs short (before the VRAM allocator would have to spill into RAM). While generations of the same model follow one another, up to 2 GB of it (5% of the RAM on smaller PCs) is kept for the next one, which reuses it at full speed; nothing is released in the middle of a generation unless the RAM runs short. It also commits only what each tensor needs, where PyTorch's allocator on Windows can commit up to twice as much.

The setting applies when WanGP starts; `--ram-allocator` takes precedence over it. It works on Windows and Linux with PyTorch 2.6 to 2.15; elsewhere, WanGP says so at startup and uses PyTorch's allocator.

### Windows Power Throttling
```bash
--no-prevent-power-throttling # Let Windows slow down WanGP in the background to save power
```
On Windows, WanGP asks by default to keep its full CPU speed when its window is minimized or in the background. Windows may otherwise slow down a background application several times, which slows down generation on the steps where the GPU waits for the CPU. On a laptop running on battery, `--no-prevent-power-throttling` saves power at the cost of slower generations while WanGP is in the background.

### Smart Memory Pinning
*Configuration / RAM/VRAM Management / Smart Memory Pinning* (On by default) speeds up the models that the memory profile does not keep in Reserved RAM: the text encoders with Profile 4, every model with Profile 5, and the part of a model that does not fit when *Reserved RAM for Pinning* is low. With it, they reach the GPU almost as fast as the models kept in Reserved RAM, for about 1-2 GB of Reserved RAM.

- It helps most with Profile 5, with image models and other generations made of short steps (low resolutions, the first pass of distilled models), and on PCs with little RAM to reserve. With long steps (high resolutions, long videos), the difference is small.
- Off: these models reach the GPU more slowly, and the 1-2 GB of Reserved RAM stay free for other programs.
- Changing this option reloads the model.

## Lora Configuration

```bash
--loras PATH                 # Root folder for default LoRA subfolders (default: loras)
--lora-config FILE           # Optional JSON mapping LoRA subfolder names to paths
--lora-preset PRESET         # Load lora preset file (.lset) on startup
--check-loras                # Filter incompatible loras (slower startup)
```

Use `python wgp.py --lora-config lora_paths.json` to override individual collections. JSON keys match the exact subfolder names in the default `loras/` folder, such as `wan`, `wan_5B`, or `flux2_klein_4b`. Values are complete directory paths; relative values resolve beside the JSON file.

JSON entries take precedence over `--loras`. Unlisted keys use the root from `--loras`, then `wgp_config.json`'s `loras_root`, then `loras/`. The former model-specific `--lora-dir*` flags have been removed. See the [LoRA guide](LORAS.md#custom-lora-directories) for a sample JSON and setup instructions.

## Generation Settings

### Basic Generation
```bash
--seed NUMBER                # Set default seed value
--frames NUMBER              # Set default number of frames to generate
--steps NUMBER               # Set default number of denoising steps
--advanced                   # Launch with advanced mode enabled

## Configuration Files

### Settings Files
Load custom settings:
```bash
python wgp.py --settings /path/to/settings/folder
```

### Config Folder
Use a separate folder for the UI config and autosaved queue:
```bash
python wgp.py --config /path/to/config
```
If missing, `wgp_config.json` or `queue.zip` are loaded once from the WanGP root and then written to the config folder.

### Lora Presets
Create and share lora configurations:
```bash
# Load specific preset
python wgp.py --lora-preset anime_style.lset

# With custom lora root
python wgp.py --loras /shared/loras --lora-preset mystyle.lset
```

## Environment Variables

While not command line options, these environment variables can affect behavior:
- `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` - Limit visible GPUs
- `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF` - CUDA memory allocation settings
- `TRITON_CACHE_DIR` - Triton cache directory (for Sage attention) 
- `WAN2GP_DEEPY_TELEMETRY=1` - Enable detailed Deepy decode, MTP, CUDA-memory, and GPU telemetry when verbose level 2 is active (disabled by default)
- `WAN2GP_FFMPEG_TIMEOUT` - Timeout in seconds when finalizing ffmpeg containers or merging continuation segments in Media Flow (default: `300.0`)
