# Spatial Upsampler Plugin API

Spatial upsamplers (Lanczos, FlashVSR, PiD, Chain-of-Zoom, VAE upscalers, ...) are
registered in `postprocessing/spatial_upsamplers.py`. Each upsampler declares itself and its
capabilities through a handler object; the registry owns dropdown state, value
parsing, validation helpers, config nesting, downloads and dispatch.

## Upsampler types

- `postprocessing`: works on decoded frames. Interchangeable: WanGP can call any of
  them through the same `upscale()` interface, both at generation time and in
  **late post processing** (Post Processing tab on existing media). Image-only
  handlers (`"media": ("image",)`) are offered for image outputs and in late
  post processing.
- `vae`: plugged directly into a model pipeline (e.g. Wan VAE 2x, PiD VAE). They
  expose capabilities through the same API. Handlers declare whether a selected
  VAE upsampler requires a main model reload (Wan VAE) or an external runtime
  session passed to the model pipeline (PiD-style upsamplers).

## Handler contract

```python
class MyUpsampler:
    def query_upsampler_def(self):
        return {
            "name": "MyUpsampler",
            "upsampler_types": ("postprocessing",),        # and/or "vae"
            "media": ("video", "image"),
            "profile": "video",                            # memory profile: video, image, or audio
            "config_key": "myup",                          # wgp_config["spatial_upsamplers"] subkey
            "pos": 100,                                     # default dropdown order for this handler's methods
            "method_pos": {"myup": 100},                    # optional per-method order; independent of multiplier
            "methods": [("MyUpsampler", "myup")],          # method dropdown entries
            "vae_methods": [],                             # VAE entries (manual integration)
            "multipliers": {"myup": (2.0, 4.0)},           # supported multipliers per method
            "default_spatial_upsampling": "myup2",
        }

    def is_upsampling(self, value): ...                    # does this handler own the value?
    def split_value(self, value): ...                      # -> (method, scale) or None
    def build_value(self, method, scale): ...              # -> value or None
    def validate_upsampling(self, value, image_mode): ...  # -> "" or error text
    # postprocessing type only:
    def upscale(self, sample, value, *, seed, ..., abort_callback, progress_callback): ...
    def download(self, process_files, send_cmd=None, status_text=None, spatial_upsampling=None): ...
    def release_vram(self): ...
    def enabled(self): ...                                 # optional UI gating
    # VAE type only:
    def supports_model_vae_method(self, method, model_type, model_def, image_mode): ...
    def prepare_vae_upsampler(self, value, *, send_cmd, process_files, init_pipe, profile, attention_mode=None): ...

    def loaded_model_vae_upsampling_value(self, model): ...

```

`SimpleScaleSuffixMixin` provides `is_upsampling`/`split_value`/`build_value` for the
common `<method><multiplier>` value encoding (e.g. `lanczos2`, `coz4`).
Handler-exposed method ids in `methods`, `vae_methods`, `multipliers`,
`method_pos`, `model_def["vae_upsamplers"]`, and
`model_def["excluded_spatial_upsamplers"]` must be multiplier-free. The multiplier
only appears in serialized `spatial_upsampling` values returned by `build_value()`
or stored as `default_spatial_upsampling`.

Dropdown entries are sorted by method position, then by method label. A handler
can define a default `pos` and override individual methods with `method_pos`.
Position is independent of multiplier; expanded choices such as `myup2` and
`myup4` share the `myup` method position.

Registration is owned by `postprocessing/spatial_upsamplers.py`. Add the handler class path
to `spatial_upsampler_handlers`:

```python
spatial_upsampler_handlers = [
    "postprocessing.my_upsampler.wgp_bridge.MyUpsampler",
]
```

`wgp.py` only calls `upsampler_api.register_spatial_upsamplers(server_config, fl)`;
it should not import or keep one explicit variable per spatial upsampler.

Enabled plugins can expose upsamplers without editing core code by adding
`spatial_upsampler_handlers` to `plugin_info.json`. Entries that start with `.`
are relative to the plugin package root; entries without a leading `.` are
absolute import paths:

```json
{
  "name": "My Plugin",
  "spatial_upsampler_handlers": [
    ".upsampler.MyUpsampler",
    "./nested/other_upsampler.py:OtherUpsampler",
    "postprocessing.my_upsampler.wgp_bridge.MySharedUpsampler"
  ]
}
```

Only enabled/loaded plugins are considered. The plugin manager reuses its cached
`plugin_info.json` metadata when registering those handlers, so the file is not
parsed a second time for upsampler discovery.

Upsampler settings are stored under `wgp_config["spatial_upsamplers"][config_key]`.
Handlers can read old top-level keys during migration with `legacy_config()`, but
those keys are deleted after the nested section is written.

SeedVR2 stores `window_size` under `spatial_upsamplers.seedvr2`. `0` selects the
GPU-based automatic limit, `-1` disables windowing, and positive values are
finite frame limits. SeedVR2 aligns finite limits down to its required `4n+1`
input shape and crossfades three overlapping output frames.

Model persistence is a registry-wide setting stored at
`wgp_config["spatial_upsamplers"]["persistence"]`; handlers must not expose a
separate persistence control in their own config section. The registry retains
at most one spatial upsampler handler. When dispatch changes handlers, it fully
releases the previous handler before loading the new one. A handler remains
responsible for releasing incompatible variants that share that handler, such as
PiD version, backbone, profile, dtype, or checkpoint-set changes.

Models declare external VAE upsampler support with method ids under
`model_def["vae_upsamplers"]`, for example:

```python
{
    "vae_upsamplers": {
        "flux_vae_pid": [1, 2],
        "flux2_vae_pid": {"image_modes": [1]},
    },
    "excluded_spatial_upsamplers": ["flux_pid"]
}
```

`excluded_spatial_upsamplers` hides post-processing methods that should not be
offered for that model, for example when a model supports the corresponding VAE
upsampler path and should not show both choices in the generation UI.

Optional attributes honored by `wgp.py`: `batch_image_inputs` (process image batches
in one call instead of per-frame). `uses_image_profile` is still accepted for older
handlers, but new handlers should declare `"profile"`.

## Extension offload object registry

Every extension that creates its own mmgp offload object (`offload.profile(...)`)
must register it in `shared/utils/offload_registry.py`:

```python
offload_registry.register_offloadobj("MyUpsampler", offloadobj, release_fn)
...
offload_registry.unregister_offloadobj("MyUpsampler", offloadobj)  # in release_fn
```

This lets WanGP track every extension offload object and release all extension
resources centrally: the toolbar "Unload Models" tool (and the Configuration plugin
release button) calls `offload_registry.release_all()`.
