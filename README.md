## 🔥 Latest Updates : 
## 5th of October 2026: WanGP v17.00 — With Great Speed Comes Even Less VRAM

I went to the future and brought back **MMGP v4** for you. 

**15 seconds of H3 video at 1080p used to require  25 GB of VRAM,  now you just need 11 GB of VRAM**.  Everybody wins, only 5-6GB of VRAM to gen 15 seconds of H3 video at 480p. 

Pair MMGP with WanGP, and your GPU punches above its weight:

- **Profile 4 is up to 25% faster and uses up to 50% less VRAM** when generating large videos. And that's on top of the optimizations that already made WanGP the go-to *Low VRAM App*. Even better: in many cases, Profile 4 now beats the old Profile 1 and matches the new Profile 1.

- **Good old failsafe Profile 5 is up to 50% faster.** Even the safety net got a turbo boost.

These VRAM savings should benefit everyone, especially at higher resolutions and longer durations. 

To get the most out of this update, first make sure you use *Sage2/2+ Attention* as quite a few optimizations depends on it. Then open the new *Config → RAM/VRAM Management* tab, choose an *MMGP Optimized VRAM Allocator* option under *VRAM Allocator*, and turn on *Smart Memory Pinning*. Restart WanGP if you change the allocator.

For an extra **20% VRAM saving**, with a speed penalty of up to 10%, go to *Config → Performance* and set *Attention Head Split* to *Medium (good balance)*. A pretty good trade-off when every gigabyte counts.

For faster model checkpoint loading on Windows, enable *Read Ahead (Windows)* in *RAM/VRAM Management*.

**Dynamic VRAM Preload** fills spare VRAM with model weights and frees space as needed. Set *VRAM Preload* to *Dynamic* for less waiting between layers, especially when generating images.

MMGP v4 puts more of your rig to work: PCIe bandwidth, SSD/NVMe speed, idle CPU cores... Actual gains will depend on your hardware. And to make updates easier, **WanGP and MMGP now live together in the same repository**.

There are also two new upsamplers to play with:

- **LTX 2.5 Detail Refiner x2**: high-quality upsampling with tiling. Just don't expect it to win any speed races.
- **H3 VAE Upsampler x2**: double the width and height of H3 videos and images as part of VAE decoding.

By pure coincidence, WanGP has just hit **10,000 GitHub stars**. If you're enjoying it, spread the word! Plenty of fellow GPU Poors could use the extra breathing room. Let's take together WanGP to **100,000 stars**.

## 29th of September 2026: WanGP v13.141 — Community Release

Thanks to **WanGP community** contributing code, testing and feedback!

**Community Contributions**

- **Live Video Previews**: watch motion develop during generation! Under *Configuration / General / Generation Preview*, choose legacy fast RGB frames, clearer Tiny VAE frames, or a looping Tiny VAE video. Click the video to pause/resume it. Thanks *@GOvEy1nw*!

- **YuE2 Score Continuation**: the *Composition source* menu lets you import or extend an ABC score, including scores transcribed from audio. Thanks *@Beanow*!

- **FLAC Audio**: import FLAC, export 16-bit lossless audio with embedded generation settings, and use FLAC soundtracks in MP4/MKV. Thanks *@Beanow*!

- **Balanced x265 Exports**: **CRF 18 (Balanced)** joins **CRF 28 (Small)** and **CRF 8 (High Quality)**. Thanks *@Beanow*!

- **More Patient Media Flow Exports**: saving and continuation merges now allow five minutes instead of 30 seconds. Thanks *@kito408*!

- **The Enhance Button Stays Put**: manual enhancement remains available when automatic enhancement is enabled. Thanks *@GKartist75*!

**Other Additions and Improvements**

- **H3 Welcomes More References**: Ref2VA now accepts up to **three reference videos and three audio references**, alongside its image references. Reference videos share a 15-second budget; audio references share a separate 15-second budget.

- **H3 Reference Excerpts**: pick up to three moments from one reference video, or independently from its soundtrack. Enter positions and optional durations, such as `5s/3s` for a three-second excerpt centred on five seconds.

- **H3 Keeps Your Soundtrack**: Ref2VA can now build a video around uploaded speech/music or a reference video's soundtrack, keeping the original audio synchronized across sliding windows. Select an audio choice marked *Soundtrack Kept*.

- **H3 Learns to Hold Still**: select **Text to Image** for a single still. The prompt enhancer gains dedicated image prompts, including reference-based edits. 

- **H3 Ref2VA Frames Injection**: Ref2VA should be now on par with Fl2VA. But keep in mind, you will get better results with Fl2VA for Start,End,Injected Frames and Text2Video

- **H3 In-Context LoRAs**: **Use Control Video as In-Context Guide** enables compatible face/character-swap LoRAs. The previous editing mode is renamed **Denoise Control Video (Video-to-Video Edit)**.

- **H3 ControlNet-Union 2.0**: **FL2VA 33B and Pruned 20B** gain pose, depth, edge, shape and recoloring controls, plus inpainting and spatial outpainting. 

- **Floating Generate Buttons**: controls float on the right until their normal position is visible; Edit Mode buttons float too. Enabled by default in **Configuration / General**.

- **Three Voices, One Conversation**: three uploaded voice references now work with **H3 Audio, Qwen3 TTS Base, OmniVoice, KugelAudio, IndexTTS2/2.5, DramaBox and Scenema**. Use `Speaker 1:` through `Speaker 3:`; Scenema applies its references through SeedVC.

- **Krea 2 Real and HD VAEs**: Krea 2 and compatible Qwen Image 20B/Edit models gain a *VAE* dropdown: try **Real** for photographic textures or **HD** for detail and contrast.

- **More LoKr Compatibility**: Krea 2, Qwen Image, Ming Image and Qwen Image 2.1 gain support for compatible decomposed LoKr adapters.

- **Deepy Learns Magic Mask**: ask Deepy to mask named objects in an image or video, invert the selection, or create simple rectangular masks. The masks go straight into the Gallery for editing.

- **Deepy Handles RGBA**: convert between RGB and RGBA, extract or recombine color channels, and use a grayscale mask as an image's transparency channel.

- **Deepy Prime Mixes and Muxes**: replace a video's soundtrack, mix audio sources, keep separate selectable audio tracks, or add selectable subtitles. The video is preserved without re-encoding.

- **Faster Deepy and Prompt Enhancement**: **GGUF CUDA kernels 1.0.25** accelerate speculative decoding for Q4_K and Bonsai PTQ1_0 without extra VRAM. See the [installation guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md).


## 24th of September 2026: WanGP v13.1315 — It's Your Lucky Day^?!

- **Qwen Image 2.1**: A new Qwen Image model with out-of-the-box editing capabilities and strong text rendering. 

WanGP supports *VRAM Optimization*, *Pose/Depth/Edge Transfer*, *Inpainting*, *LanPaint*, *Outpainting*, *KV Cache Acceleration*, and *Enhanced Prompts* from day one.

The base model works without an accelerator; optional LoRA profiles below offer faster 4- to 8-step generation.

- **Full JIT Checkpoint Loading**: WanGP now downloads preprocessing and postprocessing checkpoints only when needed, instead of downloading them all on first use. This saves disk space if you use WanGP for a specific task, such as audio generation, or want to build a portable version of WanGP.

- **Comfy Kitchen Kernels Support**: These kernels are installed automatically and can accelerate specific models. They have been integrated into H3 and LTX2.x, which are now 10% faster.

- **Minimax H3 INT8 ConvRot VAE**: Twice as fast. Now downloaded automatically and used by default when INT8 is selected in your transformer configuration. 

- **Deepy Prime for the Masses**: Thanks to the new *Bonsai 2 Abliterated PTQ1_0 checkpoint*, *Deepy Prime* and its advanced *Prompt Enhancer* can now run with **10 GB of VRAM, or possibly less**. You will need *GGUF CUDA kernels 1.0.25*. Please see the installation guide.  

- **UI Optimizations**: The UI should be even faster, especially the Image/Video Gallery.

- **Yue2 Instrumental Model Only**: you can now generate instrumentals track only, please check new option in main dropdown box and also prompt instructions or new prompt enhancer templates. 

- **Yue2 Hum to Song**: Turn a clear hummed melody, your lyrics and a music style into a new stereo song.

- **YuE2 support AR LoRAs**: YuE2 first phase, is an Auto Regressive phase (score writing phase) and it can now accept LoRAs. LoRAs for second Diffusion phase was already added previously.

- **DFlash2 & DSpark Acceleration for Deepy & Prompt Enhancer***: for an extra VRAM cost you will be able to generate up tp 200 tokens / s

- **Various UI Improvements**: add directly the current frame of Video Gallery to the Image Gallery, Extract settings of a Video/Audio/Image in Workspace Gallery 

- **Ming Image 0.1 Design**: a new image generation and editing model for detailed infographics, posters, and carefully arranged layouts. It accepts standard text prompts and a structured JSON format for more precise control over composition. WanGP's visual **Prompt Helper** lets you arrange layers and edit their positions, colors, and descriptions. You can also choose a classic or JSON prompt enhancer to turn a short brief into a detailed prompt with explicit titles, labels, and explanations.

- **Ming Image 0.1 Design-Layer**: turn a finished poster, infographic, or other design into separate transparent image layers. Provide one reference image and a text prompt describing the layers from front to back. WanGP adds every RGBA layer to the image gallery and saves a ZIP of the complete layer set. Design and Design-Layer share their language encoder and vision tower checkpoints to reduce downloads and disk use.

- **Qwen Image 2.1 Viggle Turbo LoRA Accelerators**: generate images faster with **v0.1 (4 steps)**, **v0.2 (5 steps)**, or **v0.2.1 (6 steps)**. Select an acceleration profile to apply the matching LoRA, scheduler, and recommended settings. The 6-step profile is the recommended Viggle starting point and is also available in Deepy for image generation and editing.

- **Qwen Image 2.1 Pruna LoRA Accelerators**: choose **Pruna v0.1 (5 steps)** for speed or the recommended **8-step** profile for better quality. Each profile applies its matching LoRA and Pruna scheduler with the correct sigma sequence, guidance 1, and LoRA strength 1.; Pruna's adapters were trained for edits with up to three reference images.

- **Remove Vocals Audio Postprocessing**: create an instrumental version of an audio track by removing its vocals. Available in **Post Processing**, **Late Post Processing**, and through **Deepy Prime**.


*Update v13.1313*: YuE2 instrumental mode, YuE2 Hum to Song, AR LoRA support, and DFlash2 / DSpark acceleration\
*Update v13.1314*: Ming Image 0.1 Design and Design-Layer, Qwen Image 2.1 Viggle Turbo and Pruna LoRA accelerators, and Remove Vocals audio postprocessing

## 16th of September 2026: WanGP v13.10 — It's Your Lucky Day!

**WanGP Major Release**

- **Upgraded User Interface**: a more responsive interface for switching models and browsing media, a modern look, and five color themes, including Classic Gradio. Use the microphone beside a prompt to dictate it, then review and edit the text before generating.

- **Access Anywhere**: start a generation at home and follow it from another browser or device connected to the same running WanGP server (VPN recommended for remote access). Galleries, selected media, progress, and the generation queue stay synchronized, so you can check results and add new jobs. Each Gradio page keeps its own unsent prompts and draft settings.

- **Clearer Progress and Cancellation**: see what WanGP is doing while it downloads files, loads models, encodes prompts, or generates media. Progress bars now cover more stages, and you can request cancellation during preparation as well as generation.

- **Workspaces**: keep generated and imported media organized by project, with collections and selections remembered after restarting WanGP. Switch workspaces between tasks, or open the workspace manager beside the gallery selector to browse the full collection, reorder items, copy or move them between workspaces, and download a selection as a ZIP. Copying media between workspaces does not duplicate the files on disk. See the [workspace guide](docs/WORKSPACES.md).

- **Deepy Web App**: take Deepy with you in a phone-friendly interface. Upload a photo or recording, describe what you want, and follow the conversation and results from your phone or desktop. Open **Web app →** in Deepy's settings to find it, and add it to your phone's home screen for quick access. See the [Deepy guide](docs/DEEPY.md). You can use this way both *Deepy Zero* & *Deepy Prime*, although you will get best results with *Deepy Prime*.

- **Prompt Enhancer Upgrades**: when using a Qwen3.5/3.8 powered Prompt Enhancer, now all attached images (Start Image/End Image/Control Image/Ref Images) may be used to produce the enhanced prompt. The prompt enhancer is also given the duration of the video / sliding window you want to generate (this works also when prompt commands like [\duration=3s] are used). Even better multiple sliding windows prompts can be enhanced at the same time based on the actual start/end frames they will see.

**New Models**

- **YuE2**: turn lyrics and a musical style into a complete song with vocals and accompaniment. The cover workflow can extract melody and chords from a source song to guide a new performance; supply the lyrics separately and keep them aligned with the original sections.

- **AuK Speech**: generate speech from written instructions, or use a source recording for voice cloning, spoken-word edits, speech cleanup, and speaker separation. Choose **Flash** for a fast four-step result or **Base** for more control. Start with a short clip and describe both what to change and what to preserve.

- **LTX2.5 updates**: added LTX 2.5 MSR (reference to videos), LTX 2.5 Ingredients is now used when Ref. Images are provided, updated Media Flow processes with LTX 2.5 unblur and uncompress LoRAs

*update 13.10*: Prompt Enhancer Upgrades, LTX2.5 updates

## 6th of September 2026: WanGP v12.72 — Power Up, Polish, Pause
- **H3 VDN**: at least 20% Faster and even more on larger / longer videos, requires a bit more VRAM and Triton must be installed

- **DLSS 5 Neural Rendering — More Than an Upscale**: give finished images and videos an AI polish that can enrich lighting and material appearance, improve fine features such as skin, hair, fabric, and foliage, and keep enhancements stable over time. Use x1 for native-resolution refinement or x1.5–x3 to refine and enlarge, with adjustable intensity. WanGP estimates depth and motion for recorded media, so results remain content-dependent. See the **[DLSS 5 overview](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/adlr/DLSS5/)** and **[installation guide](docs/DLSS5.md)**.

- **Fast Temporal Upsampling up to x6**: DLSS Frame Generation uses a native RTX path designed for real-time multi-frame generation, so it should generally run faster than RIFE on supported hardware while turning low-FPS footage into smoother video. It supports x2–x4 on compatible RTX 40/50 GPUs and x5/x6 where supported on RTX 50. **RIFE v4.26 now adds x3 temporal upsampling** alongside x2/x4, with no extra native DLSS runtime.

- **Media Flow / Temporal Upsampling & Neural Engine**: DLSS5 / Rife Temporal Upsampling and DLSS5 Neural Engine can now be used in Media Flow, so you can convert your entire collection of stop motion movies.

- **H3 Voice Audio**: a new TTS preset reuses MiniMax H3 Ref2VA Pruned for voice cloning and general audio generation. It accepts one or two audio references, under the hood it denoises a hidden 32x32 video for speed, skips video decoding, and saves only 32 kHz stereo audio.

- **H3 Outpainting**: discover the truth that lies beyond the borders of the H3 frames, also available in *Media Flow*

- **H3 Audio Refinement Extra Phase:** optionally improve the soundtrack after FL2VA or Ref2VA video generation using 6 extra steps without LoRAs. WanGP preserves the original full-resolution video and audio latents, locks the video exactly, partially re-noises only the audio at 0.5 denoising strength, and then decodes the refined result. The pass deliberately does not re-inject reference media or the original Control Video. It is unavailable when an FL2VA soundtrack controls generation and on fixed 8-step PDD variants.

- **Viggle Animate**: a H3 Based model similar to Wan Animate but 3 steps only. Give Viggle a Control Video and an Edited Frame  (the person or object to animate injected in one frame taken from the control video, use a WanGP Image Editor or ask Deepy). Motion is quite good, but model will need to build 5s long sliding windows.

- **Deepy Goodies**:
  - **Pause and resume** Deepy without losing its progress. Pausing temporarily releases its GPU and VRAM resources for another WanGP task or application; an active tool is allowed to finish safely first.
  - **Optional sessions** continuously preserve the conversation, displayed cards, workspace, and media used or generated by Deepy. Resume past work, switch sessions, or rename, duplicate, export, and delete them from the interface.
  - **Faster responses** through decoding optimizations that can improve speed from 50% to 100%, depending on the model and configuration. (please update to the latest *GGUF 1.0.24 kernels*, see *docs/INSTALLATION.md*)
  - **Qwen3.8 27B IQ3_S** offers a new middle ground between Q2 and Q4: better quality than Q2 with a lower memory footprint than Q4, while remaining compatible with faster speculative decoding. It may make 16 GB VRAM configurations practical with suitable context settings.

  
*update WanGP v12.72**: H3 Outpainting, Viggle Animate


See full changelog: **[Changelog](docs/CHANGELOG.md)**


## 🚀 Quick Start

### One-click Bat/SH Script Auto-installer:

The 1-click automated scripts for both **Windows (`.bat`)** and **Linux/macOS (`.sh`)** make installation, environment management, and updates as seamless as possible. These scripts will not only install WanGP but also best acceleration kernels (Triton, Sage, Flash, GGuf, Lightx2v, Nunchaku) available for your config.

*👉 **Windows Users:** Double-click the `.bat` files. **Linux Users:** Run the `.sh` files in your terminal.*

#### **1️⃣ Installation (`scripts\install.bat` | `scripts/install.sh`)**

**Choose Installation Type**
- **Auto Install**
- **Manual Install**

**Manual Install**

If you selected Manual Install, you will be guided through:

1. **Choose your package manager**
2. **Name your environment**
3. **Select your Install Mode**

#### 2️⃣ Starting the App (`scripts\run.bat` | `scripts/run.sh`)
Once installed, use this script to launch the application. It runs WAN2GP using your active environment.

*   **⚙️ Customizing Launch Arguments (`args.txt`)**
    *   If you want to pass extra command-line flags to the launcher (like enabling advanced UI features or automatically opening your browser), create an `args.txt` file in your `scripts` folder.
    *   **Example `args.txt`:**
        ```text
        --advanced --open-browser
        ```

#### 3️⃣ Updating & Upgrading (`scripts\update.bat` | `scripts/update.sh`)
Use this script to get the latest updates for WAN2GP and upgrade dependencies.
* **1. Update:** Fetches the latest code from GitHub and updates requirements.
* **2. Upgrade:** Allows you to manually individually upgrade heavy backend components (like PyTorch, Triton, Sage Attention).

Triton recommendations follow both your GPU and selected PyTorch: **3.3.x with PyTorch 2.7**, **3.6.x with PyTorch 2.10** on RTX 30XX or newer, **3.2.x on RTX 20XX**, and **3.7.x with PyTorch 2.13** on AMD. Use **Upgrade** to correct an older Triton installation; **Update** alone does not change it.

#### 4️⃣ Managing Environments (`scripts\manage.bat` | `scripts/manage.sh`)
Use this script to manage and switch between your sandboxed environments safely.

* **Example Scenario 1: Migrating an Existing Setup**
    * If you have a folder named `venv` that works perfectly and want to use it with the new one-click scripts, run `manage.bat` and select **Add Existing Environment**.
    * Copy-paste the folder path (e.g., `C:\WAN2GP\venv`), select type `venv`, then use **Set Active Environment** to make it the default. Now `run.bat` and `update.bat` will target your existing setup.

* **Example Scenario 2: Testing New Configurations**
    * Let's say you have an environment named `env_stable` that works perfectly, but you want to try different components. Run `install.bat`, create a *new* environment called `env_testing`, and select **Manual Selection**. **Autoselect** installs the recommended stack for your GPU.
    * If the testing environment breaks, simply open `manage.bat`, select **Set Active Environment**, and switch back to `env_stable`. You are back up and running instantly.

### One-click Installers
- Pinokio installer
Get started instantly with [Pinokio App](https://pinokio.computer/)\
It is recommended to use in Pinokio the Community Scripts *wan2gp* or *wan2gp-amd* by **Morpheus** rather than the official Pinokio install.

- Wan2GP Desktop by GKArtist
[Wan2GP Desktop](https://github.com/GKartist75/Wan2GP-Desktop-Tauri) is a desktop launcher for Wan2GP that installs, updates, and runs it from one window — handling Git, Python, CUDA, and PyTorch setup so you don't have to configure them manually.

### Manual installation: (for RTX20xx - RTX50xx)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Wan2GP.git
cd Wan2GP
conda create -n wan2gp python=3.11.14
conda activate wan2gp
pip install torch==2.10.0 torchvision==0.25.0 torchaudio==2.10.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

On Windows, install Triton in the same environment, using the command matching your GPU and PyTorch:

| GPU | PyTorch | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RTX 30XX - RTX 50XX | 2.10 (recommended) | `python -m pip install -U "triton-windows>=3.6,<3.7"` |
| RTX 30XX - RTX 50XX | 2.7 / 2.7.1 | `python -m pip install -U "triton-windows>=3.3,<3.4"` |
| RTX 20XX | 2.7 or 2.10 (legacy Triton compatibility exception) | `python -m pip install -U "triton-windows>=3.2,<3.3"` |

Triton 3.2 on RTX 30XX or newer can crash YuE2's optimized INT8 ConvRot kernels because it lacks `triton.language.gather`. Upgrade Triton as above and restart WanGP. RTX 20XX must stay on 3.2 and uses the existing standard INT8 path; compatibility with newer PyTorch is not guaranteed upstream. RTX 50XX users should use PyTorch 2.10 / Triton 3.6 for WanGP's optimized INT8 and NV FP4 support. Linux normally receives matching Triton through PyTorch. See the **[Triton Installation Guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md#triton-installation)** for details and RTX 20XX limitations.

For optimized attention, install **SageAttention 1.0.6 on RTX 20XX** and **SageAttention 2.2.0 on RTX 30XX or newer**. SageAttention 2 requires an Ampere-or-newer GPU; GTX 10XX should use SDPA. See the **[Installation Guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md#sage-attention)** for the platform-specific commands.

### Manual installation: (for GTX 10xx)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Wan2GP.git
cd Wan2GP
conda create -n wan2gp python=3.10.9
conda activate wan2gp
pip install torch==2.7.1 torchvision==0.22.1 torchaudio==2.7.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/test/cu128
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Run the application:

```bash
python wgp.py
```
If you are low on VRAM, there is a trick to increase the amount of VRAM available (between 1GB and 5GB of VRAM to be gained depending on the GPU): *disable GPU Usage in your Web Browser*.

Run *scripts/start-chrome-no-gpu.bat* or *scripts/start-chrome-no-gpu.sh* to launch Chrome without using your GPU. 

First time using WanGP ? Just check the *Guides* tab, and you will find a selection of recommended models to use.

#### Windows: Diagnose and Free VRAM

If you still run out of VRAM on Windows with an NVIDIA GPU, open Command Prompt in the WanGP folder and list the applications using GPU memory:

```cmd
scripts\gpumem.cmd
```

This shows per-process VRAM usage, sorted from highest to lowest, followed by total GPU memory usage. To attempt to reclaim idle VRAM, stop generation, activate your WanGP Python environment, and run:

```cmd
scripts\gputrim.cmd
```

Trimming briefly applies memory pressure to encourage Windows to move idle GPU allocations to system RAM, then releases its allocations and displays updated usage. It can briefly stall GPU applications, and savings are not guaranteed. By default, it refuses if a process other than the Windows desktop compositor uses more than 1 GB; close GPU-heavy applications before retrying.

#### Update the application (stay in the current python / pytorch version):
If using Pinokio use Pinokio to update otherwise:
Get in the directory where WanGP is installed and:
```bash
git pull
conda activate wan2gp
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Upgrade from Python 3.10, Pytorch 2.7.1, Cuda 12.8 to Python 3.11, Pytorch 2.10, Cuda 13/13.1 (for non GTX10xx users)
I recommend renaming first the old conda environment to avoid bad surprises when installing a different config in this old environment.

```bash
conda rename -n wan2gp  old_wan2gp
```

Get in the directory where WanGP is installed and:
```bash
git pull
conda create -n wan2gp python=3.11.9
conda activate wan2gp
pip install torch==2.10.0 torchvision==0.25.0 torchaudio==2.10.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once you are done you will have to reinstall *Sage Attention*, *Triton*, *Flash Attention*. Check the **[Installation Guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md)** -

if you get some error messages related to git, you may try the following (beware this will overwrite local changes made to the source code of WanGP):
```bash
git fetch origin && git reset --hard origin/main
conda activate wan2gp
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
When you have the confirmation it works well you can then delete the old conda env:
```bash
conda uninstall -n old_wan2gp --all  
```

#### Run headless (batch processing):

Process saved queues without launching the web UI:
```bash
# Process a saved queue
python wgp.py --process my_queue.zip
```
